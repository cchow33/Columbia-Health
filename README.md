**About the Project**

This is a website for Columbia Health Hospital, a nationally ranked medical centre in Toronto that provides expert health and medical care to patients in the local community.

This website connects patients to the hospital's key services, weekly newsletter, and the dozens of physicians and specialists that make up their multi-disciplinary team of medical experts. Patients can also log in to their private accounts to view their patient history and prescribed treatment plans.
